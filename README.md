# udacity
i am learning how to make a project on github for my udacity course. it's too early for me to be able to launch a full fledge project here. so for now i will just be documenting my learning experience in my readme file.

I discovered the readme file. i know how to edit and delete it. 
the option was available for me in the repository creation step.
i can see why readme file is such an important part of the github. just 5 minutes here and can already see the utility of this file.

i will be documenting my further experience here soon. looking forward to pull and push
